  "body": "### What is Who's Got What?\r\nWho's Got What? is a task organization center for households or groups that share a space or responsibilities.  It allows for parents or admins to manage task lists for each child or base user.  In managing these lists, parents can add tasks, review completed tasks, send out notifications and messages to the group or specific users, and view analytics on task statistics. Base users can view lists that have been created for them, see what is due, check off tasks as they are completed, view upcoming tasks, receive notifications and messages from parents or other users. Added functionality for swapping tasks between users, achievements, and leaderboards will bring a friendly competitive aspect to getting chores done around the house.  Parents can use this app to designate points or monetary values to certain tasks or customize rewards for task completion. Users can see a running balance of points accrued and any other rewards earned. With Who's Got What? you can see who has what tasks, who has completed them and earn rewards and have fun at the same time!\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
